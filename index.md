## DisInfoSec is an online cybersecurity conference featuring disabled speakers

So the COVID19 pandemic has killed conventional cybersecurity conferences and events which meet offline. That's okay, we can have cybersecurity events online! Inspired by [BeerConOne](https://thebeerfarmers.org/beer-con-one-bc1/) and Lesley Carhart's [PancakesCon](https://tisiphone.net/2020/03/15/pancakescon-2020-quarantine-edition/amp/), cybersecurity blogger Kim Crawley has decided to start an online cybersecurity conference of her own. But this time, the spotlight will be on **disabled people** with infosec knowledge.

## Saturday, July 11th 2020

DisInfoSec was originally planned to take place on Saturday, June 13th 2020. It will now take place on **Saturday, July 11th 2020!**
