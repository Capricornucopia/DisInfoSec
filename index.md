## DisInfoSec 2021, Saturday September 18th

The first DisInfoSec happened on Saturday, July 11th, 2020. 

Well, guess what? It's official. DisInfoSec 2021 is on! The tentative date is Saturday, September 18th, 2021.

This year, we will feature more disabled people talking about cybersecurity. No professional experience is required, as long as you have something to say. We will provide subtitles and all content in descriptive audio to make our event accessible to Deaf and blind people. 

I, Kim Crawley, learned a lot from running last year's event. We had a lot of great speakers, as you can read from last year's schedule. But the video stream could be glitchy at times, and my smoke detector wouldn't stop beeping! Hahaha. This year, we can work out some of the bugs.

I am delighted by the overwhelming postive reception we have received. So I'm bringing DisInfoSec 2021 together due to popular demand. 

## Call for Proposals

So I'm launching our CFP on June 6th. [Please submit them through this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYeIJDFJGqu4GDErNm4I0tQlWC9G0tQqNbWoTji7Nru3T0bw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

You have until Wednesday, August 25th, 2021 to submit a proposal. Don't be shy! Newbies are welcomed. I accepted all of the CFPs I got last year. I don't need "proof" of disability, self-identification as disabled is fine. If you have good ideas and something to say, I welcome your input.

All applicants will be notified about CFP approval on Friday, August 27th.

## Raising Funds

DisInfoSec is a completely free online event, simulcasted with live captioning on Twitch and YouTube.

But if you can afford to donate money to a good cause, we welcome it.

Last year, we raised money for the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, the Autistic Women and Nonbinary Network, and the Council for Canadians with Disabilities. This year, I want to consider supporting some other organizations. The prequisite is that the organization must be 100% run by disabled people.

I welcome your suggestions for disabled person-run organizations to support. Please email me at runnymede13@gmail.com.

## Job Posting

This year, I can afford to pay a couple of people out of my own pocket to help make DisInfoSec a success. 

Here's what we need...

**Video Stream Director**

We need someone with experience with Twitch and YouTube streaming through OBS Studio and Restream.io. Experience with live capitioning plugins is a bonus. 
You will work about two to four hours in **the week before September 18th** setting up our video stream, and about five to seven hours **on September 18th** to help keep things running well during the event. 

You will be paid a total of $400.00 CAD (Canadian dollars) for your labour, with $200.00 paid before the event, and $200.00 paid after. Payment can be made via PayPal, Interac Etransfer, or certified cheque/check in your local currency. 

If you're interested in the job, please email Kim Crawley at runnymede13@gmail.com by Wednesday, August 25th, 2021 at the latest.

**Sign Language Interpreter**

I would love to fill this position, because using sign language can be a better accessibility solution than live captioning alone.

If we can find a sign language interpreter, profeciency in American Sign Language and/or British Sign Language is a plus. You will be working about five to seven hours on September 18th.

You will be paid a total of $400.00 CAD (Canadian dollars) for your labour, with $200.00 paid before the event, and $200.00 paid after. Payment can be made via PayPal, Interac Etransfer, or certified cheque/check in your local currency.
