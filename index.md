## DisInfoSec is an online cybersecurity conference featuring disabled speakers

So the COVID19 pandemic has killed conventional cybersecurity conferences and events which meet offline. That's okay, we can have cybersecurity events online! Inspired by [BeerConOne](https://thebeerfarmers.org/beer-con-one-bc1/) and Lesley Carhart's [PancakesCon](https://tisiphone.net/2020/03/15/pancakescon-2020-quarantine-edition/amp/), cybersecurity blogger Kim Crawley has decided to start an online cybersecurity conference of her own. But this time, the spotlight will be on **disabled people** with infosec knowledge.

Do you identify as disabled and have cybersecurity knowledge you'd like to share? DisInfoSec would love to feature you as a speaker! Cybersecurity nerds presenting at DisInfoSec may have any level of experience in their careers, and may be from every infosec specialty, from redteamers to network admins, from SOC analysts to CISOs, from malware researchers to desktop support, from students to teachers, from web application developers to the recently made unemployed.

## Saturday, June 13th, 2020

DisInfoSec takes place on **Saturday, June 13th, 2020.** It will be hosted via Zoom and broadcasted via Twitch. **All people are welcome to attend, whether or not you're disabled.** Watch this space for more info about presentation times and how to attend, or [fill out this form to be notified when online attendance information becomes available.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTZZKmW8F4d_mLfXgzTFmqCfpR8cGz-M-XHvXV9uJuVz6JNw/viewform)

## Call for Proposals (CFPs)

## Am I disabled?

You are disabled if you have a disabling condition **and** self-identify as disabled. No medical documentation is necessary! (Don't share your sensitive medical info with strangers on the internet, that's bad opsec. Ha!) Disabilities can include, **but absolutely aren't limited to** the following:

- Neurodivergent conditions such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, learning disorders, developmental disabilities, and mental health conditions such as anxiety, dissociative identity disorder, eating disorders, and bipolar disorder.

- Conditions that affect how you sense the world, such as being Deaf or blind.

- Conditions that affect your physical mobility, such as cerebral palsy, amputations, paraplegia, or Parkinson's disease.

- Conditions that affect how you fit into the world, such as Dwarfism.

- Other conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome or traumatic brain injuries.

Your disabilities may not be on this list. Your disabilities might not be medically diagnosed or recognized by the government. **The most important factor is that you self-identify as disabled. We don't need proof of a disability.**

## Let's make DisInfoSec accessible to as many disabilities as possible!

If you're disabled and you know how an online streaming video event can be made more accessible for you, [please submit your ideas in this form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScc90kqggCMwmYvulv-otFO1CdhJlbr97EVZDWs_SN78YSknQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) We're already considering transcriptions and American Sign Language for Deaf people and descriptive audio for blind people. If you have ideas for implementing that, or if there are ways that DisInfoSec can be accessible for other disabilities, [please submit your ideas in this form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScc90kqggCMwmYvulv-otFO1CdhJlbr97EVZDWs_SN78YSknQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)
