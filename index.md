## DisInfoSec 2021, Saturday September 18th

The first DisInfoSec happened on Saturday, July 11th, 2020. 

Well, guess what? It's official. DisInfoSec 2021 is on! The tentative date is Saturday, September 18th, 2021.

This year, we will feature more disabled people talking about cybersecurity. No professional experience is required, as long as you have something to say. We will provide subtitles and all content in descriptive audio to make our event accessible to Deaf and blind people. 

I, Kim Crawley, learned a lot from running last year's event. We had a lot of great speakers, as you can read from last year's schedule. But the video stream could be glitchy at times, and my smoke detector wouldn't stop beeping! Hahaha. This year, we can work out some of the bugs.

I am delighted by the overwhelming postive reception we have received. So I'm bringing DisInfoSec 2021 together due to popular demand. 

## We have a corporate sponsor!

Thank you mongoDB! Your generous donation will go toward paying our video stream director, paying for Zoom and related technical services, and the balance will be divided between the disabled people we are raising funds for this year.

mongoDB will get lots of shoutouts during the event. It's great to see a tech company show their love for disabled people in our industry.

## We have a video stream director!

Welcome Chloe "FlyingKaida" on board as our very first employee. She will be running our video stream behind the scenes. 

Check out her [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_jgy0f-DMr7NXC0afjzUbQ) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/flyingkaida) channels when you have a chance.

## Raising Funds

DisInfoSec 2021 will encourage participants ans spectators who can afford to do so to donate to three disabled people directly. I can acknowledge that sometimes charities rub by disabled people can do good work. But alas, this year I'm disillusioned by the charity model. Giving money to people directly is the best way to help a person. Unless your aims are to do something which requires a lot of money and collective effort, such as cancer research.

This tweet from our Twitter account will explain how you can help. And once all the details have been verified, we will update our website with donation info accordingly: [Here is the tweet.](https://twitter.com/DisInfoSec/status/1425593209351192583?s=09)

Ashe Grey a.k.a. @crippledscholar needs a service dog. [Here's their GoFundMe.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/get-an-autism-and-anxiety-service-dog-for-kim)
